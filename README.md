# Session 5 – Test Cases and code understanding
## time_it implementation using *args and **kwargs
### def time_it(fn, *args, repetitons= 1, **kwargs): 
The repetitons indicate the number of times the function has to be calculated.
## It has these functions defined:
1)  polygon_area : Calculates the area of polygon (sides can be 3 to 6). We have calculated the area of a regular polygon – having all the sides equal. The input is the side length and the number of sides. 
2)  temp_converter : Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit to Celsius. The input is the temperature and the unit of the temperature given.
3)  print : It prints the value of the input given in args with a specified separator and end.
4)  squared_power_list : It generates a list by calculating the power of the given number. For example, if 2 is the number we are calculating power of and with start = 0 and end = 5 we get the result as [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32].
5)  speed_converter : It converts the given speed in km/hr to different metrics. Here, distance can be km or m or ft or yrd and time can be ms or s or min or hr or day.
## Test Cases
1)  README exists
2)  README has at least 500 words
3)  Methods mentioned in README
4)  README file formatting 
5)  Code Indentation and spaces
6)  Function name should be in small letters
7)  All the above 5 functions used
8)  Repetitions in time_it function should be greater than or equal to 1
9)  fn in time_it should be any of the 5 functions used above
