## time_it implementation using *args and **kwargs
### def time_it(fn, *args, repetitons= 1, **kwargs): 
The repetitons indicate the number of times the function has to be calculated.
## It has these functions defined:
1)  polygon_area : Calculates the area of polygon (sides can be 3 to 6). We have calculated the area of a regular polygon – having all the sides equal. The input is the side length and the number of sides. 
2)  temp_converter : Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit to Celsius. The input is the temperature and the unit of the temperature given.
3)  print : It prints the value of the input given in args with a specified separator and end.
4)  squared_power_list : It generates a list by calculating the power of the given number. For example, if 2 is the number we are calculating power of and with start = 0 and end = 5 we get the result as [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32].
5)  speed_converter : It converts the given speed in km/hr to different metrics. Here, distance can be km or m or ft or yrd and time can be ms or s or min or hr or day.
